==== ====

Claude Code can connect to hundreds of external tools and data sources through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) , an open-source standard for AI-tool integrations. MCP servers give Claude Code access to your tools, databases, and APIs. 

=== ​ 

What you can do with MCP ===
With MCP servers connected, you can ask Claude Code to: 
Implement features from issue trackers : “Add the feature described in JIRA issue ENG-4521 and create a PR on GitHub.” 
Analyze monitoring data : “Check Sentry and Statsig to check the usage of the feature described in ENG-4521.” 
Query databases : “Find emails of 10 random users who used feature ENG-4521, based on our Postgres database.” 
Integrate designs : “Update our standard email template based on the new Figma designs that were posted in Slack” 
Automate workflows : “Create Gmail drafts inviting these 10 users to a feedback session about the new feature.” 

=== ​ 

Popular MCP servers ===
Here are some commonly used MCP servers you can connect to Claude Code: 

Use third party MCP servers at your own risk - Anthropic has not verified
the correctness or security of all these servers.
Make sure you trust MCP servers you are installing.
Be especially careful when using MCP servers that could fetch untrusted
content, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.
