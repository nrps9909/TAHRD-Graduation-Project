==== ====

== ​ 

Themes and appearance ==
Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That’s handled by your terminal application. You can match Claude Code’s theme to your terminal any time via the /config command. 
For additional customization of the Claude Code interface itself, you can configure a custom status line to display contextual information like the current model, working directory, or git branch at the bottom of your terminal. 

== ​ 

Line breaks ==
You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code: 
Quick escape : Type \ followed by Enter to create a newline 
Keyboard shortcut : Set up a keybinding to insert a newline 

= ​ 

Set up Shift+Enter (VS Code or iTerm2): =
Run /terminal-setup within Claude Code to automatically configure Shift+Enter. 

= ​ 

Set up Option+Enter (VS Code, iTerm2 or macOS Terminal.app): =
For Mac Terminal.app: 
Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard 
Check “Use Option as Meta Key” 
For iTerm2 and VS Code terminal: 
Open Settings → Profiles → Keys 
Under General, set Left/Right Option key to “Esc+“ 

== ​ 

Notification setup ==
Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration: 

= ​ 

Terminal bell notifications =
Enable sound alerts when tasks complete: 
claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell 

For macOS users : Don’t forget to enable notification permissions in System Settings → Notifications → [Your Terminal App]. 

= ​ 

iTerm 2 system notifications =
For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete: 
Open iTerm 2 Preferences 
Navigate to Profiles → Terminal 
Enable “Silence bell” and Filter Alerts → “Send escape sequence-generated alerts” 
Set your preferred notification delay 
Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the default macOS Terminal. 

= ​ 

Custom notification hooks =
For advanced notification handling, you can create notification hooks to run your own logic. 

== ​ 

Handling large inputs ==
When working with extensive code or long instructions: 
Avoid direct pasting : Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted content 
Use file-based workflows : Write content to a file and ask Claude to read it 
Be aware of VS Code limitations : The VS Code terminal is particularly prone to truncating long pastes 

== ​ 

Vim Mode ==
Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with /vim or configured via /config . 
The supported subset includes: 
Mode switching: Esc (to NORMAL), i / I , a / A , o / O (to INSERT) 
Navigation: h / j / k / l , w / e / b , 0 / $ / ^ , gg / G 
Editing: x , dw / de / db / dd / D , cw / ce / cb / cc / C , . (repeat)
