Claude Code works great with any Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has a terminal. Just run claude , and you’re ready to go. 
In addition, Claude Code provides dedicated integrations for popular IDEs, which provide features like interactive diff viewing, selection context sharing, and more. These integrations currently exist for: 
Visual Studio Code (including popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium) 
JetBrains IDEs (including IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, WebStorm, PhpStorm and GoLand) 

=== ​ 

Features ===
Quick launch : Use Cmd+Esc (Mac) or Ctrl+Esc (Windows/Linux) to open
Claude Code directly from your editor, or click the Claude Code button in the
UI 
Diff viewing : Code changes can be displayed directly in the IDE diff
viewer instead of the terminal. You can configure this in /config 
Selection context : The current selection/tab in the IDE is automatically
shared with Claude Code 
File reference shortcuts : Use Cmd+Option+K (Mac) or Alt+Ctrl+K (Linux/Windows) to insert file references (e.g., @File#L1-99) 
Diagnostic sharing : Diagnostic errors (lint, syntax, etc.) from the IDE
are automatically shared with Claude as you work 

=== ​ 

Installation ===
VS Code+ 
JetBrains 
To install Claude Code on VS Code and popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium: 
Open VS Code 
Open the integrated terminal 
Run claude - the extension will auto-install 

To install Claude Code on VS Code and popular forks like Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium: 
Open VS Code

To install Claude Code on JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, WebStorm, PhpStorm and GoLand, find and install the Claude Code plugin from the marketplace and restart your IDE. 

The plugin may also be auto-installed when you run claude in the integrated terminal. The IDE must be restarted completely to take effect. 

Remote Development Limitations : When using JetBrains Remote Development, you must install the plugin in the remote host via Settings > Plugin (Host) . 

=== ​ 

Usage ===

== ​ 

From your IDE ==
Run claude from your IDE’s integrated terminal, and all features will be active. 

== ​ 

From external terminals ==
Use the /ide command in any external terminal to connect Claude Code to your IDE and activate all features. 
If you want Claude to have access to the same files as your IDE, start Claude Code from the same directory as your IDE project root. 

=== ​ 

Configuration ===
IDE integrations work with Claude Code’s configuration system: 
Run claude 
Enter the /config command 
Adjust your preferences. Setting the diff tool to auto will enable automatic IDE detection 

=== ​ 

Troubleshooting ===

== ​ 

VS Code extension not installing ==
Ensure you’re running Claude Code from VS Code’s integrated terminal 
Ensure that the CLI corresponding to your IDE is installed: For VS Code: code command should be available 
For Cursor: cursor command should be available 
For Windsurf: windsurf command should be available 
For VSCodium: codium command should be available 
If not installed, use Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
and search for “Shell Command: Install ‘code’ command in PATH” (or the
equivalent for your IDE) 

Check that VS Code has permission to install extensions 

== ​ 

JetBrains plugin not working ==
Ensure you’re running Claude Code from the project root directory 
Check that the JetBrains plugin is enabled in the IDE settings 
Completely restart the IDE. You may need to do this multiple times 
For JetBrains Remote Development, ensure that the Claude Code plugin is
installed in the remote host and not locally on the client
